This is a Bash shell script that provides a naive encryption utility using ROT13 and the Caesar's cipher. It provides a menu driven text interface.
The following features were included:

   •Provide a looping menu of options. This menu provides choices to the user, takes input, executes some tasks, then returns to the menu.
   
   •The user may choose to read a message in from a file or type a message.
   
   •If reading from a file, prompt the user for the file name to use. Otherwise, allow typed input.
   
   •Prompt the user to choose ROT13 or CC.
   
   •If choosing the CC, allow the user to determine the number of shifts.
   
   •Prompt to ‘Encrypt’ or ‘Decrypt’ a message.
   
   •Ask the user for the name of the output file.
   
   •Perform the requested operations.
   
   •Save the result in the output file and display on the screen.
   
   •Return to the main menu
